# ML-Happiness-Classification-Analysis-Project

The dataset we will be working with comprises responses from the survey conducted among residents of different cities. It includes the following features:

infoavail: Availability of information about city services.

housecost: Cost of housing in the city.

schoolquality: Overall quality of public schools.

policetrust: Trust in the local police.

streetquality: Maintenance of streets and sidewalks.

events: Availability of social community events.

happy: Decision attribute indicating happiness, with values 0 (unhappy) and 1 (happy).

We will explore the relationships between these features and happiness, perform data analysis and visualization, and build a classification model to predict happiness based on the given attributes.
